# TicTacToe + TicTacToe-AI:

# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Features:
Two-player game (Human vs Computer) – A simple implementation where the human plays against a random AI.
Command-line interface – The game runs in the terminal, displaying the board after each move.
Win detection – Checks for a winning row, column, or diagonal.
Move validation – Ensures only valid moves are allowed.
Turn-based play – Alternates turns between ‘X’ (Human) and ‘O’ (Computer).

# How It Works:
A 3x3 board is represented using a list.
The player and computer take turns selecting a square.
After each move, the board updates, and the game checks for a winner or a tie.
If a win condition is met, the game announces the winner and stops.

# Key Learnings:
Handling user input and validating moves.
Implementing basic game logic such as turn-based play and win detection.

# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 

# Features:
AI opponent using Minimax algorithm – The AI makes optimal moves instead of random ones.
Unbeatable AI – The computer never loses unless the game ends in a draw.
Improved move selection – The AI evaluates all possible moves to determine the best one.
Same command-line interface – Easy to interact with.
Efficient win detection – Uses optimized checks to determine game results.

# How It Works:
Uses the Minimax algorithm, which simulates all possible moves and selects the best one.
The AI recursively evaluates each move’s outcome and assigns scores based on winning or losing conditions.
The algorithm ensures the computer either wins or forces a tie.
The player still inputs moves, but the AI always plays optimally.

# Key Learnings:
Understanding recursion through the Minimax algorithm.
Game theory concepts like optimal decision-making.

# How to Play:
You can change the example board and run in the link given below Steps: Firstly, click on the link given below. Next, Click on Remix this app... Now, You will get into environment where you can see the run, then click on console, You can play the game. For running the game use command "python3 game.py"
